In less than 5 days I will be officially finsihed with college! It feels like just yesterday I was sitting for the first time in my introductory general chemistry course in a lecture hall with more students in it than my entire high school graduating class. Three and a half years later I can say that I've learned quite a bit academically and about myself. Next semester I plan to work and travel before starting dental school in August!!
